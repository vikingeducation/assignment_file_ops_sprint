Instructions: This assignment will require you to loosen up those file I/O and Regex muscles. You'll need to read in a dictionary file and create a simple parser that will search for words within it. This is a good chance to practice highly modular design and work with "micro classes" which can help you perform a variety of specific tasks.

Overview of this project - creation of a dictionary search application with the following functionalities:
  1. allows various search types for words including:
    - exact match search
    - partial match search
    - matching beginning of word search
    - matching end of word search
  2. automatic parsing of dictionary file into suitable data structure for data manipulation
  3. automatic compilation of search results into a suitable data structure
  4. allows user to automatically convert search results into a file with a single command
  5. gives feedback to user when incorrect commands are used
    - e.g. when file location exists: re-prompts user to enter a new file location
